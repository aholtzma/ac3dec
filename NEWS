a52dec-0.7.1 Thu Aug 30 02:13:23 PDT 2001

Minor release for bugfixes. Looks like 0.7.0 was a bit rushed out.

Now compiles with gcc 3.0, made sure mlib implementation works, and
fixed a small bug in the a52dec test program.


a52dec-0.7.0 Thu Aug 23 23:18:00 PDT 2001 

First release since more than one year !

The most user-noticeable additions are the downmix to arbitrary
speaker configurations, and the implementation of dynamic range
compression.

The speed has been improved by a factor of 2 to 3, the conformance and
precision should be higher, and we also fixed a small bug when playing
stereo rematrixed streams.
