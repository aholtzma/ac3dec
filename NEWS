a52dec-0.7.0 Thu Aug 23 23:18:00 PDT 2001 

First release since more than one year !

The most user-noticeable additions are the downmix to arbitrary
speaker configurations, and the implementation of dynamic range
compression.

The speed has been improved by a factor of 2 to 3, the conformance and
precision should be higher, and we also fixed a small bug when playing
stereo rematrixed streams.
