ac3dec - a free AC-3 stream decoder

Written by Aaron Holtzman (aholtzma@engr.uvic.ca)

See the file COPYING for license details.

Currently the only platform supported is SOLARIS. If you want
Linux support, then take a look at output_linux.c and hack away.

This software is completely useless to 99.99 percent of users
out there. It is mostly of use to those interested in audio
coding research and evaluating codecs. It could theoretically
be used as a portion of a DVD playback system for unix systems. 
There are issues with DVD encryption and licensing that need to be
resolved however.

USAGE

To find AC-3 streams on the internet, use www.google.com and 
search for "vob trailer". A vob is a "Video Object" which is
just an MPEG-2 stream. The site www.hollywood.com has a 
few good MPEG-2s with AC-3 audio. The program tools/extract_ac3 
will take an MPEG-2 stream and spit out AC-3 audio to stdout if
it exists. You can easily pipe this data to the ac3 player like
this:

  ./tools/extract_ac3 foo.vob | ./decode
