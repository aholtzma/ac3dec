- Mute frame on error.
- Detect hrtime on solaris and enable it via config.h
- Add multilevel debug output
- Separate uint_* typedefs from ac3.h
- the output signal from the IMDCT sometimes is outside the rand
  of [-1.0,1.0]. This is why there is the normalization pass in
	output.c. Need to investigate and hopefully we can move the
	normalization.
